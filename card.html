            <p>Budgerigars are naturally green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back and wings, but have been bred in captivity with colouring in blues, whites, yellows, greys and even with small crests. Budgerigars are popular pets
                around the world due to their small size, low cost and ability to mimic human speech.</p>
